# Wide Industries GS
An OpenTTD game script that makes served industries multiply as their production grows.

## What it does
This script will create more industries around existing served industries when they increase their production above a certain threshold, up to a specified limit.

## Why
In vanilla gameplay, industries only grow "tall" (or rather, "deep"), increasing their production up to roughly 2500 units while not taking any more space on the map. Because of that the player is forced to build huge stations around those now tiny industries. This script aims to change that scaling the size of the industry on the grid without introducing any new graphics or breaking compatibility with various newgrf industry sets.
